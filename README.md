### About Me
I’m a distributed ledger specialist with a deep focus on high-performance cryptographic algorithm design. I'm a multi-disciplenary researcher and engineer in the fields of cryptography, machine-learning, and quantum computing.
I investigate and seek out the interplay of these technologies, and how they can be used for an overall good.

### Research Highlights

- **Computational Analysis of Plausibly Post-Quantum-Secure Recursive Arguments of Knowledge (Paper 2024/1698)**  
  Presents a formal analyis of quantum security of recursive zero-knowledge arguments, systematically examining each component of a STARK and analyzing the potential hardness against quantum attacks.

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation and Differential Privacy Applied to DGA Detection (PLOS ONE, 2022)**  
  Developed a secure MPC protocol enabling efficient private classification over sensitive network traffic logs, with safeguards against inversion side channels.

- **Computational Attestations of Polynomial Integrity (Future Technologies Conference, 2024)**  
  Introduced an argument system to validate privacy mechanisms in machine learning training, achieving near real-time performance for differentially private regressions on large datasets.
